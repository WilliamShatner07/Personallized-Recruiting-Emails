Hey Karl,



Saw that you were just promoted from Sr. Engineer to Staff Engineer, but I
wanted to see whether I could persuade you to take an additional jump by
checking out an Architect role at a well-funded software product shop
called RhinoDox. For personal background =E2=80=93 I placed Demetri Maltsin=
iotis
and Mike Davis. Guessing that you=E2=80=99ve gotten some cloud architecture
exposure at Echo like the two guys I mentioned. If that=E2=80=99s the case,=
 the
opportunity at RhinoDox would give you a chance to really hone those skills
and grow into their Chief Architect as the company develops.



For background, RhinoDox is a NoSQL-driven document management software
platform looking to add an Architect to help guide their engineering
departments through upcoming architectural and technical challenges as the
company scales from start-up. RhinoDox leverages a combination
linguistics-informed NoSQL (MarkLogic) and .NET MVC to create a platform
capable of drawing inferences from stored documents, allowing their product
to continuously improve the quality of its own search and suggestion
engine. One of the most appealing aspects about the company is that all of
their engineers are allowed to work remotely while office space at
TechNexus is provided when you want to work together in-person.



Your specific role would be evaluating the possibility of a new API
authentication system and architecting a new micro services architecture
that leverages Lambda (and therefore migrating the platform to .NET  Core).
Specially you=E2=80=99d be replacing a guy named Mike Knuth (
https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelknuth), taking his work and bringing
that knowledge internal and refactoring code as needed so that the platform
is able to scale with new client acquisition. The company emphasizes a
culture of encouraging constant learning (their first company value
references Yoda) and aims to hire engineers with the talent to grow into
their role at the company. On the team you=E2=80=99d be working with Travis=
 Whelan (
https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-whelan-8141792), Marty McKenna (
https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmckenna) and several other engineers who
I=E2=80=99ve also placed.



Culturally, the company offers a culture of constant learning and a genuine
commitment to doing right by their clients. The company is founded and
funded by Justin Ullman a serial entrepreneur, ex-software engineer/
linguistics geek, and a founder of the Bucktown Beefsteak
https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150205/bucktown/annual-beefsteak-celebrat=
es-manly-gluttony-buffoonery-for-good-cause,
who heavily invested in creating a worthwhile ahead-of-the-curve software
platform that he=E2=80=99s now looking to further develop on. He had the in=
itial
code base for RhinoDox built out by DragonSpears, one of the top software
consultancies in Chicago, but brought on Travis (who moved over from a
well-regarded competitor) to lead engineering efforts as they built out an
internal team. In short, your role would be specifically to work as the
Chief Architect, making core technology decisions, doing R&D, and helping
to guide the future of the platform from a tech perspective as they grow
the development team



What=E2=80=99s your situation? I know you just got promoted, but I think th=
is a
pretty special opportunity that would give you the chance to really grow
your career with a company that=E2=80=99s well-funded, working with excelle=
nt
engineers.



Let me know,


Ethan
